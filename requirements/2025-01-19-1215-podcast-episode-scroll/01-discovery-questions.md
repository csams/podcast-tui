**Default if unknown:** Yes (better user experience to remember where they were)

## Q3: Should there be visual indicators (like scrollbars) to show scroll position and available content?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (robust applications handle all edge cases properly)

## Q5: Should page-up/page-down functionality be implemented in addition to line-by-line scrolling?
