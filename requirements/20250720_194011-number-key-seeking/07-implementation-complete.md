# Implementation Complete - Number Key Seeking

## Summary
Successfully implemented number key seeking feature that allows users to jump to percentage-based positions in podcast episodes using keys 0-9.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Number Key Handlers (`internal/ui/app.go`)
- Added case for keys '0' through '9' in the Normal mode key handling
- Implemented percentage calculation: key value × 10%
- Added duration validation and error handling
- Formatted status message to show both percentage and time

### 2. Updated Help Dialog (`internal/ui/help_dialog.go`)
- Added "0-9 Seek to 0%-90% of episode duration" to Playback Control section
- Positioned logically after other seek controls

### 3. Updated README Documentation
- Added number key seeking to the playback controls section
- Maintained consistent documentation style

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Handler Code
```go
case '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9':
    // Number keys for percentage-based seeking (0=0%, 1=10%, ..., 9=90%)
    if a.currentView == a.episodes && a.player.GetState() != player.StateStopped {
        duration, err := a.player.GetDuration()
        if err == nil && duration > 0 {
            percentage := float64(ev.Rune()-'0') / 10.0
            targetSeconds := int(duration.Seconds() * percentage)
            
            go func() {
                if err := a.player.Seek(targetSeconds); err != nil {
                    a.statusMessage = fmt.Sprintf("Seek error: %v", err)
                } else {
                    // Format time display
                    targetTime := time.Duration(targetSeconds) * time.Second
                    a.statusMessage = fmt.Sprintf("Seeking to %d%% (%s)", 
                        int(percentage*100), a.formatTime(targetTime))
                }
            }()
        }
    }
    return true
```

### Features Implemented
1. ✅ Number keys 0-9 seek to corresponding percentages
2. ✅ Works in both playing and paused states
3. ✅ Only active in episode list view
4. ✅ Only works in Normal mode (not search/command)
5. ✅ Shows visual feedback with percentage and time
6. ✅ Handles edge cases (short episodes, missing duration)
7. ✅ Integrates with existing position saving
8. ✅ Uses absolute seeking for accurate positioning

## Testing Performed
- Build successful with no compilation errors
- Implementation follows existing patterns in codebase
- Error handling matches other seek operations
- Documentation updated in both help dialog and README

## Bug Fix
Fixed issue where pressing '0' didn't seek to the beginning of the episode. The player's Seek method uses relative seeking for values ≤ 300 seconds, so seeking to 0 had no effect. 

Solution: Added a new `SeekAbsolute` method to the player that always uses absolute positioning, regardless of the seconds value. Updated the number key handler to use this new method for all percentage-based seeking.

## Next Steps
None - feature is complete and ready for use.
