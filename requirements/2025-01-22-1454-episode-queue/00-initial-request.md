# Initial Request: Episode Queue System

## User Request
Create an episode queue system so I can enqueue multiple episodes I want to listen to. If I press the l or Enter keys in the episode list, the selected episode should be enqueued. If it is the only episode in the queue, it should start playing. If an episode is already in the queue, the new episode should just be added to the queue. The episode queue should be displayed in a window 15 lines high directly below the description window. Its columns should have playback state indicators like a playing episode in the current episode list view, title of the podcast it belongs to, the title of the episode, the publication date of the episode, and Position/Duration that updates using the same behavior as the current episode list view. If I push TAB while in the podcast or episode list views, focus should shift to the queue window. If I push tab while in the queue window, focus should shift back to the podcast or episode list window, depending on which one is visible. The queue window should be visible at all times. If the queue window has focus, scrolling should work using j and k like it does for the other list views. Pressing d on an episode in the queue window should remove the episode from the queue. if it is playing, the next episode in the queue should start playing instead. if the queue is empty after it is removed, stop playback. order the queue list with the most recently added episode at the top. alt+j should move the selected episode down in the queue, and alt+k should move the selected episode up. whichever episode is as the top of the queue should be the one playing.
