# Initial Request

Create a queue of podcast episodes. When pressing enter or 'l' in an episode list, the selected episode is added to the queue. If it is the first episode in the queue, it should start playing. Otherwise, it should be added to the queue. If an episode is playing and finishes, it should be removed from the queue, and the next episode in the queue should start playing automatically. Use the table abstraction to create a new window to display the queue that is exactly like the one used in the episode list view in terms of columns, style, indicators, scrolling. The entire status bar at the bottom should also have identical look and behavior as in the podcast list and episode list views. However, the queue view should not have a description window at the bottom. The TAB character should activate the queue view from either the podcast or episode views, and TAB on the queue view should restore the previous view.
