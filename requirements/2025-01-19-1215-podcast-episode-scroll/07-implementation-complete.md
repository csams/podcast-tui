# Implementation Complete

**Completed:** 2025-01-19 12:20
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

## Summary
All requirements for podcast and episode list scrolling have been successfully implemented and tested. The implementation includes smart centered scrolling, vim-style page navigation, enhanced description window, and robust edge case handling.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`internal/ui/podcast_list.go`**
   - Added `screenHeight` field for tracking terminal dimensions
   - Implemented `ensureVisible()` method with smart centering
   - Added `HandlePageDown()` and `HandlePageUp()` methods
   - Bounds checking and edge case handling

2. **`internal/ui/episode_list.go`** 
   - Added `screenHeight` field for tracking terminal dimensions
   - Implemented `ensureVisible()` method accounting for 10-line description window
   - Added `HandlePageDown()` and `HandlePageUp()` methods  
   - Updated description window from 6 to 10 lines
   - Complex layout calculations for table + description

3. **`internal/ui/app.go`**
   - Added `tcell.KeyCtrlF` and `tcell.KeyCtrlB` keybinding handlers
   - Proper delegation to current view's page scroll methods
   - Maintains existing keybinding precedence

4. **`internal/ui/help_dialog.go`**
   - Updated navigation section to document Ctrl+F/B keybindings

### Features Implemented ✅

#### Core Scrolling
- [x] Smart `ensureVisible()` methods that center selections when possible
- [x] Line-by-line scrolling with j/k keys (already existed, now functional)
- [x] Vim-style page scrolling with Ctrl+F (forward) and Ctrl+B (backward)
- [x] Boundary-respecting scrolling (stops at edges, no wrapping)

#### Layout Enhancements  
- [x] Description window increased from 6 to 10 lines
- [x] Episode list scrolling accounts for 10-line description area
- [x] Proper calculation of available viewport space

#### State Management
- [x] Scroll positions maintained when switching between views
- [x] Episode list resets (selectedIdx=0, scrollOffset=0) when selecting new podcast
- [x] Screen height tracked and updated during Draw() calls

#### Edge Cases
- [x] Empty lists handled gracefully (no crashes)
- [x] Single-item lists work correctly
- [x] Small terminal windows handled appropriately  
- [x] Bounds checking prevents invalid scroll positions

## Testing Performed

### Build Verification
- [x] `go build` - No compilation errors
- [x] `go fmt` - Code properly formatted
- [x] `go vet` - No issues detected

### Functional Testing
- [x] Line navigation (j/k) triggers ensureVisible()
- [x] Page navigation (Ctrl+F/B) moves by screen pages with overlap
- [x] g/G (top/bottom) navigation works with proper scrolling
- [x] View switching preserves scroll positions
- [x] New podcast selection resets episode list position
- [x] Help dialog shows updated keybindings

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✅

### AC1: Basic Scrolling Works ✅
- [x] j/k navigation smoothly scrolls when selection moves off-screen
- [x] Selected item is centered in viewport when scrolling
- [x] g/G keys properly scroll to top/bottom with correct positioning

### AC2: Page Scrolling Works ✅  
- [x] Ctrl+F scrolls forward by approximately one screen
- [x] Ctrl+B scrolls backward by approximately one screen
- [x] Page scrolling maintains one line of overlap for context
- [x] Page scrolling stops at list boundaries

### AC3: State Management Works ✅
- [x] Podcast list remembers scroll position when switching to episodes
- [x] Episode list remembers scroll position when switching to podcasts  
- [x] Episode list resets when selecting a different podcast
- [x] No scroll position corruption during view transitions

### AC4: Layout Enhancement Works ✅
- [x] Description window is 10 lines tall instead of 6
- [x] Episode table scrolling accounts for 10-line description area
- [x] Table layout remains properly formatted during scrolling

### AC5: Edge Cases Handled ✅
- [x] Empty lists don't crash or behave unexpectedly
- [x] Single-item lists work correctly (no unnecessary scrolling)
- [x] Very small terminal windows handled gracefully
- [x] Rapid navigation doesn't cause visual glitches

## Next Steps
The scrolling implementation is complete and ready for use. No further development is required for this feature set.
